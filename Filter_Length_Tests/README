MCMC (mcmc_filter_length_tests.py) automatically runs on "data_fs_4_N=49_FOR_RUN.dat" 
in Data_Simulation directory outside of this one but user can change the file name inside the code.

Command line arguments will be the filter length you want use. Output chain will have filename
"chainfile_N=[].dat"

So run "python mcmc_filter_length_tests.py -p [filter length integer (must be odd)]"

Data used for plots in paper are in MCMC subdirectory here, and plotted in the Plot subdirectory.
